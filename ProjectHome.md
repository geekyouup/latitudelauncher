UPDATE, March 2010: Development on this project has ceased as Latitude is available by upgrading to the latest version of Google Maps in the Android Market.

Latitude isn't enabled in the UK, and some other countries, on the T-Mobile G1, however it is enabled on many other phones e.g. Nokia N95. This is frustrating, a Google phone without Google Latitude.

This application can enable Latitude for you if you have 'Rooted' your phone. It checks for a row in the Gservices table, if it doesn't exist it adds it and launches the Maps application.
